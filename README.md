# FlaskReverseProxy
Reverse Proxy implemented with Flask on Python. It serves over HTTP or HTTPS, answers to OPTIONS calls with CORS headers, and functions well with MJPEG restreaming. Was build as supplement for Google's OpenSphericalCamera (OSC) protocol, and specifically for the WebAPI of Ricoh Theta V.
